# About Me

<img src="https://chenyong.com/chenyong.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Yong Chen ([陈永](https://caihanlin.com/file/蔡汉霖简历.pdf))**.

I am a first year PhD student in **Hydraulic Engineering** at Tianjin University and **Geotechnical engineering** at Nanjing Hydraulic Institute (China, Combined Degrees). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhenyin Cai](http://a.xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B0G9EKJK) and [Prof. Mingchao Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mingchao-Li). Here is [my Resume](https://caihanlin.com/file/Resume-HanlinCAI.pdf).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Artificial intelligence in dredging engineering. It can be divided into two parts: 1) **elucidating geotechnical risk management**; 2) **Data mining in dredging construction**. I am looking for **visiting-student positions** and willing to keep on fighting for efficient and safe construction of dredging engineering.
